In this section your Security and Cloud Administrators will consider whether or not they want to define and deploy an initial set of security guardrails for limiting access within your test and production workloads AWS accounts.

See [Environment Guardrails]({{< relref "03-guardrails" >}}) for an introduction to the use of guardrails that you can apply to your AWS environments.  Guardrails are governance rules for security, operations, and compliance that customers can select and apply enterprise-wide or to specific groups of accounts. You might start with a basic set of guardrails and expand them as you gain experience and your needs evolve.
