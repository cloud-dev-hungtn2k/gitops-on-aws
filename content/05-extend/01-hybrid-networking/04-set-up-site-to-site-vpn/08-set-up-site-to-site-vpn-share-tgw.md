In this section, you will share your transit gateway with other AWS accounts in your AWS organization so that VPCs in those accounts can be attached to the transit gateway.  This is a one-time operation.

{{< toc >}}

## 1. Enable resource sharing in your organizations management AWS account

{{% notice info %}}
**Attaching team development VPC:** The team development VPC is created and managed in the same **`network-prod`** AWS account in which your transit gateway was created. Consequently, you do not need to share the transit gateway resource in order to attach the common team development VPC to your transit gateway. However, since your other VPCs will reside in separate AWS accounts, you will need to enable resource sharing and share the transit gateway in order to attach those VPCs.

You will need to enable sharing resources within your AWS Organizations from your management account.  This will allow you to access your transit gateway from the other AWS accounts that are part of your AWS organization.

**Resource sharing may already be enabled:** If you already set up a common team development VPC, then you've already enabled resource sharing and can skip this step.
