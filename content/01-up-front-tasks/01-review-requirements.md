This section introduces the typical requirements for your initial foundation in support of development, test, and production environments. You will typically require at least the following capabilities when establishing your initial formal environments. 

Depending on your requirements, you might need to include additional capabilities in support of deploying your first few proof of value workloads to production. Setup instructions for [common optional capabilities]({{< relref "05-extend" >}}) are included later in this guide to help you meet these requirements.

Depending on the types of initial proof of value workload, you'll likely have more requirements that are workload specific.

## Cloud Adoption Framework Perspectives

The following requirements are organized based on a series of perspectives defined in the [AWS Cloud Adoption Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/CAF/).

## Business Perspectives

### Business

**Company Payment Instrument** - Use of company authorized payment instrument, e.g. corporate credit card, by centralized cloud owner to pay for AWS cloud resources.

**Cost Reporting** - Transparent and frequent cost reporting with alerts for greater than expected consumption.

### People

**Initial Cloud Foundation Team** - The organization must have at least a few technologists who are assigned to and capable of configuring and managing the initial phases of the enterpriseâ€™s use of AWS. Initially, these technologists might be members of either the same team that own the first few proof of value workloads or your central IT organization that supports the team that owns the proof of value workloads. Over time, this initial team may evolve into a larger dedicated "cloud platform" or "cloud platform engineering" team.

**Workload Owners** - The teams who own the first few proof of value workloads.

**Cross-functional Stakeholders** - Cross-functional teams such as Security, Compliance, Network, Operations, and Finance are important stakeholders in the use of the AWS platform and must be part of the initial planning, design, and implementation effort.

### Governance

**Sufficient Access Controls** - Sufficient access controls and permissions to protect the cloud foundation resources from inadvertent and intentional modification by unauthorized users.

**Clearly Defined Roles and Responsibilities** - Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for managing the use of AWS.

## Technical Perspectives

### Platform

#### Builder Team Requirements

**Sufficiently Isolated Team Development Environments** - An isolated environment for each team to carry out initial experiments and formal development work.

**Avoid Cross-Team Impacts** - Isolation from other builder teams being able to inadvertently impact a team's cloud resources.

**Cross-team Workload Access** - Ability to access other builder teams' deployed services via networking where agreed and explicitly configured.

**Access from Corporate Desktops** - Access to AWS services and AWS-hosted workloads from the corporate desktops on the corporate network. Includes access to the AWS Management Console, AWS services APIs, and use of the AWS CLI.

**Access to Broad Set of AWS Services** - Access to a broad set of AWS services to enable experimentation and development.

**Ability to Develop and Test Workload-specific Resources** - Including broad access to create and manage application-oriented AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and policy resources in support of experimenting and developing application and data services.

**Access to AWS Network Environment** - Access to an AWS network environment in support of those AWS services for which private networking is either required or desirable.
  
**Access to Select Internet Resources** - Access to Internet-hosted code and package repositories so that 3rd party packages and code can be downloaded to VMs hosted in AWS.

**Access to Corporate Source Code and Artifact Management Service** - Use of corporate source code management and artifact management services to manage code and access artifacts used in support of experiments and development.

**Self-Service AWS Costs Insights** - Insight into the costs of AWS services consumed in their development environments so that teams can make informed decisions.

**Builder User Documentation** - Sufficient documentation to enable builders to get started with your AWS environment.

{{% notice tip %}}
**Access to on-premises resources:** It's common that your builder teams' development environments and your test and/or production environments in AWS will need to have connectivity to some of your on-premises resources. For example, there may be existing test and production data services in your on-premises environment that your workloads in AWS will need to access.  If this is the case, you should review [On-premises Network Integration]({{< relref "01-hybrid-networking" >}}) for an overview of your options.

#### Cloud Foundation Team Requirements

**Foundation Development Environment** - The initial cloud foundation team needs an isolated environment in which they can develop and test foundation capabilities.
  * Separate from other builder teams and environments.
  * Potentially with wider access permissions than typical development teams to enable deeper foundation development work.

### Security

Since your first few proof of value workloads will be deployed to production, your existing security requirements for production applications should be applied.  The following requirements are examples that typically apply at this stage of adoption.

**Isolate AWS Development from Corporate Resources** - Sufficient isolation between cloud development environments and existing corporate resources.

**Inhibit Public Exposure of Cloud Resources** - Inhibit builder teams from making workloads and data publicly accessible from their development environments.

**Audit All AWS Activity** - Sufficient auditing of cloud access and activity and separation of duty for access to audit data.

**Role Based Access Control** - Access to the AWS platform must be controlled via role based access control.  Permissions should be assigned to roles. Your Cloud Foundation team members and workload owning builders who need direct access to AWS services should must their own identities rather than shared user accounts.

**Reuse your corporate identity store and overall RBAC processes:** It's common for organizations planning to adopt AWS to require use of their existing corporate identity store and overall role based access control (RBAC) tools and procedures to grant users entitlements to applications. This guide recommends that you start simple by first using a small set of users and groups defined locally in the AWS SSO service.  Once you've established your initial foundation in AWS, the guide provides a summary of your federated access options and resources to enable you to evolve your AWS environment to use your existing corporate identity source.  See [Federated Access to Your AWS Environment]({{< relref "02-federated-access-to-aws" >}}) for an overview of your options.

**Multi-Factor Authentication** - Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all human user access to the AWS platform.

**Inhibit Use of Locally Managed IAM Users** - Inhibit use of IAM users for human access.

**Inhibit Use of Long-term AWS Access Keys** - Inhibit use of long-term access keys to access AWS services.

### Operations

Since your first few proof of value workloads will be deployed to production, your existing operational requirements for production applications should be applied.  The following requirements are examples that typically apply at this stage of adoption.

**Workload Operational Runbooks** - A sufficient set of runbooks to support common operational needs and scenarios for the first few proof of value workloads.

**Cloud Foundation Operational Runbooks** - A sufficient set of runbooks to support setup and ongoing management of using AWS.

**AWS Support** - Prior to deploying workloads to production, you should sign up for "Business" level AWS Support for at least one of your AWS accounts.
