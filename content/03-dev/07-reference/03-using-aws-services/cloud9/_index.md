This section helps you understand how to use the cloud-based [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) IDE in your team development AWS accounts. Since you don't have access to public subnets in your team development AWS accounts and there are guardrails established around your team development AWS accounts, you'll need to take into consideration the impact of these aspects on your use of Cloud9. This section helps you address those considerations.

## What is AWS Cloud9?

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. 

Learn more about Cloud9 in the [AWS Cloud9 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/welcome.html).
